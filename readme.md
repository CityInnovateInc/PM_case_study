# Product Manager Case Study

Dear candidates,

The case study assignment below doesn't have correct answers per se, instead the goal is to start a conversation between us on things like your approach, how will you engage stakeholders, and design decisions. As an acknowledgment of your time, candidates are paid $100 Amazon gift card for an expected 1-2 hours to complete the case study. It is a commitment we ask from people at this point in the process. We want to invest the time in making sure we are a good fit for each other as much as reasonably possible. If you have any questions, please drop me a note.

1.  Our product roadmap has multiple themes, each 5+ EPICs/initiatives. Please describe your approach for prioritization. Feel free to have a written response or use a simulated product roadmap/spreadsheet. Specifically, include the following in your response:

* How do you track progress against the product roadmap?
* How do you keep stakeholders updated on progress of the roadmap?
* How do you identify which features require user validation / research and allocate time for that in the Roadmap??

2.  Using your approach for product roadmap prioritization, how would you organize and prioritize a large product backlog with 100+ items that are currently prioritized based on intuition. Feel free to have a written response, use a kanban, or diagram. Specifically, include the following in your response:

* How do you balance prioritization of backlog against new items?
* How do you track progress against the product roadmap and keep stakeholders informed?
* Any other relevant information that would be useful

3.  You joined CI as a PM. You've received the third customer request this month for changes to our forms functionality that was released six months ago. In the support tickets, one of the tickets requests specific additional fields. The other two would like some mechanism to modify the static forms. As an MVP feature, we've kept it very simple and only have a static form that addresses most use cases. The form is managed by government procurement officials and is posted online for vendors to respond to about their qualifications and capabilities for a specific project.

**Scenario 1: 2 week sprint** --- After discussions with the broader team, we've established that we will allocate a single two week sprint in the next cycle which is two weeks from now for addressing the above form improvements. With this time/resource constraint, how would you approach addressing the customer requests.

Expectations:

* Describe your overall approach how you would engage/collaborate with internal/external stakeholders
* No need for visual diagrams

**Scenario 2: 6 week sprint** --- After discussions with the broader team, we've established that we will allocate a single six week sprint in the next cycle which is four weeks from now for any improvements. With this time/resource constraint, how would you approach addressing the customer requests.

Expectations:

* Describe your overall approach and how you would engage/collaborate with internal/external stakeholders
* Describe new features as user stories which can make the entire experience smoother for users
